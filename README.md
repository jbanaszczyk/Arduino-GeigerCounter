# Arduino: Geiger Counter library

Arduino project to count pulses from an RadiationD-v1.1-CAJOE

From technical point of view: there is nothing special: single pin, triggering with a falling edge.

You will find there
* some collected manuals
* short: how to avoid high voltage shock
* short: how to use sensor together with 3.3V logic boards
